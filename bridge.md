# ROS1 to ROS2 Bridge

Setting up a bridge between ROS1 and ROS2 involves creating a ROS1-ROS2 bridge node that converts messages between the two systems. Here are the steps to set up the bridge:

1. Install ROS1 and ROS2 on the same machine or two separate machines that are connected in the network.

2. Install the ROS1-ROS2 bridge package in ROS2:

$ sudo apt install ros-`<distro>`-ros1-bridge



Note: Replace `<distro>` with the ROS2 distribution you are using, such as `foxy`, `galactic`, etc.

3. Start the ROS1-ROS2 bridge:

$ ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge



4. Once the bridge is running, you can start publishing messages from ROS1 nodes to ROS2 topics or vice versa. For example, to publish a message from a ROS1 node to a ROS2 topic, you can use the `rostopic` command-line tool:

$ rostopic pub /ros1_topic_name std_msgs/String "hello"



This will publish the message "hello" to the ROS1 topic `/ros1_topic_name`, which will be converted and forwarded to the corresponding ROS2 topic.

5. Similarly, to subscribe to messages from a ROS1 topic in ROS2, you can use the `ros2 topic echo` command-line tool:

$ ros2 topic echo /ros1_topic_name



This will print out any messages received on the ROS2 topic that corresponds to the ROS1 topic `/ros1_topic_name`.

Note: The ROS1-ROS2 bridge has some limitations and not all message types can be converted between the two systems. You may need to modify your ROS1 and ROS2 code to use message types that can be converted by the bridge, or implement your own custom message conversion logic.

# ROS1 to ROS2 Bridge for the Scan Topic

If you just want to convert the `scan` topic from ROS1 to ROS2, you can use the `ros1_bridge` package that provides a pre-built bridge between the `sensor_msgs/LaserScan` message in ROS1 and ROS2. Here are the steps to set up the bridge:

1. Install the `ros1_bridge` package in ROS2:

$ sudo apt install ros-<distro>-ros1-bridge


Note: Replace `<distro>` with the ROS2 distribution you are using, such as `foxy`, `galactic`, etc.

2. Start the `ros1_bridge`:

$ ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge


3. In ROS2, subscribe to the `scan` topic using the `ros2 topic echo` command-line tool:

$ ros2 topic echo /scan


4. In ROS1, publish to the `scan` topic using the `rostopic pub` command-line tool:

$ rostopic pub /scan sensor_msgs/LaserScan '[0,0,0,[0,1,2],[0,0,0],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]' -r 10



This will publish a dummy `sensor_msgs/LaserScan` message to the `scan` topic in ROS1. The `ros1_bridge` will automatically convert the message to the equivalent message in ROS2 and forward it to the `/scan` topic in ROS2,
